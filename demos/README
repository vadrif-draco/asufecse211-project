TL;DR: Existing demonstration videos have been re-uploaded in "issues" and removed from this folder, and any new demonstration videos will be uploaded there directly


Hi
This used to be the directory in which we'd upload demonstration videos for all tasks concerning lab progress and reports
However, this turned out to be very inefficient and infeasible on the long run; GitHub is not the most convenient for videos on the repository
Accordingly, all existing demonstration videos have been removed from this folder and re-uploaded as "issues" in the repository (allows media playback)
Additionally, any future demonstration videos will be uploaded as issues directly from this point onwards. Media files are now in the .gitignore of this repository
